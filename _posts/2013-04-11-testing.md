### Writing a Test

* ember-testing
* helpers
* unit/acceptance

The default tests in Ember CLI use the [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) library.
The included tests demonstrate how to write both unit tests and
acceptance/integration tests using the new [ember-testing package](http://ianpetzer.wordpress.com/2013/06/14/getting-started-with-integration-testing-ember-js-using-ember-testing-and-qunit-rails/).

To run the tests in your browser using the QUnit interface, run `ember server`
and navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/tests`. Note that just like your app, your
tests will auto rebuild when `ember server` is running.

{% highlight bash %}
ember test
{% endhighlight %}

#### Using moduleFor

Ember CLI includes a way to minimize what you have to load into the runtime during testing.
Included under the [helpers](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit/tree/master/tests/helpers)
directory is the [module-for.js](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit/blob/master/tests/helpers/module-for.js).
This file provides convenience methods that will only load what is truly necessary for your test.

* moduleFor
* moduleForModel
* moduleForComponent

##### moduleFor(fullName, description, callbacks, delegate)

The generic resolver that will load what you specify. The usage closely follows QUnit's own `module` function.
Its use can be seen within the supplied [index-test.js](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit/blob/master/tests/unit/routes/index-test.js):

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
moduleFor('route:index', "Unit - IndexRoute", {
  // only neccessary if you want to load other items into the runtime
  // needs: ['controller:index']
  setup: function () {},
  teardown: function () {}
});
{% endhighlight %}

`fullname`

The resolver friendly name of the object you are testing.

`description`

The description that will group all subsequent tests under. Defaults to the `fullname`.

`callbacks`

You are able to supply custom setup, teardown, & subject functionality by passing them
into the callbacks parameter. If other objects should be loaded into Ember.js, specify the objects
through the `needs` property.

`delegate`

To manually modify the container & the testing context, supply a function as the delegate
matching this signature `delegate(container, testing_context)`.

`this.subject()` calls the factory for the object specified by the fullname and will return an instance of the object.

##### moduleForModel(name, description, callbacks)

Extends the generic `moduleFor` with custom loading for testing models:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
import { test, moduleForModel } from 'appkit/tests/helpers/module-for';
import Post from 'appkit/models/post';

moduleForModel('post', 'Post Model', {
  needs: ['model:comment']
});

test('Post is a valid ember-data Model', function () {
  var post = this.subject({title: 'A title for a post', user: 'bob'});
  ok(post);
  ok(post instanceof DS.Model);
  ok(post instanceof Post);
});
{% endhighlight %}

`name`

The name of the model you are testing. It is necessary to only supply the name,
not the resolver path to the object(`model:post` => `post`).

`description`

The description that will group all subsequent tests under. Defaults to the `name`.

`callbacks`

You are able to supply custom setup, teardown, & subject functionality by passing them
into the callbacks parameter. If other objects should be loaded into Ember.js, specify
the objects through the `needs` property.

Note: If the model you are testing has relationships to any other model, those must
be specified through the `needs` property.

`this.store()` retrieves the `DS.Store`.

`this.subject()` calls the factory for the `DS.Model` specified by the fullname and
will return an instance of the object.

##### moduleForComponent(name, description, callbacks)

Extends the generic `moduleFor` with custom loading for testing components:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
import { test , moduleForComponent } from 'appkit/tests/helpers/module-for';

moduleForComponent('pretty-color');

test('changing colors', function(){
  var component = this.subject();

  Ember.run(function(){
    component.set('name','red');
  });

  // first call to $() renders the component.
  equal(this.$().attr('style'), 'color: red;');

  Ember.run(function(){
    component.set('name', 'green');
  });

  equal(this.$().attr('style'), 'color: green;');
});
{% endhighlight %}

`name`

The name of the component you are testing. It is necessary to only supply the name,
not the resolver path to the object(`component:pretty-color` => `pretty-color`).

`description`

The description that will group all subsequent tests under. Defaults to the `name`.

`callbacks`

You are able to supply custom setup, teardown, & subject functionality
by passing them into the callbacks parameter. If other objects should be loaded into Ember.js,
specify the objects through the `needs` property.

`this.subject()` calls the factory for the `Ember.Component` specified by the fullname and
will return an instance of the object.

The first call `this.$()` will render out the component. So if you want to test styling,
you must access the component via jQuery.
