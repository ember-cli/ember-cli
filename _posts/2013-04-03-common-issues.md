### npm package manangement with sudo

Installing packages such as bower with sudo powers can lead to permissions
issues and ultimately to problems installing dependencies.

For example

{% highlight bash %}
Uncaught Error: Could not find module ember/resolver loader/loader.js:42
{% endhighlight %}

can be caused by installing bower with sudo. See [#354](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/issues/354) for details.

### Installing from behind a proxy

If you're behind a proxy, you might not be able to install because `ember-cli` &mdash; or some of its dependencies &mdash; tries to `git clone` a `git://` url. (In this scenario, only `http://` urls will work).

You'll probably get an error like this:

```bash
npm ERR! git clone git://github.com/jgable/esprima.git Cloning into bare repository '/home/<username>/.npm/_git-remotes/git-github-com-jgable-esprima-git-d221af32'...
npm ERR! git clone git://github.com/jgable/esprima.git 
npm ERR! git clone git://github.com/jgable/esprima.git fatal: unable to connect to github.com:
npm ERR! git clone git://github.com/jgable/esprima.git github.com[0: 192.30.252.129]: errno=Connection timed out
npm ERR! Error: Command failed: fatal: unable to connect to github.com:
npm ERR! github.com[0: 192.30.252.129]: errno=Connection timed out
```

This is not a `ember-cli` issue _per se_, but here's a workaround. You can configure `git` to make the translation:

```bash
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
```

### Usage with SublimeText 3

If you are using SublimeText 3 with `ember-cli`, by default it will try to index all files in your `tmp` directory for its GoToAnything functionality.  This will cause your computer to come to a screeching halt @ 90%+ CPU usage.  Simply remove these directories from the folders ST3 watches:

`Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings -User`

{% highlight javascript %}
// folder_exclude_patterns and file_exclude_patterns control which files
// are listed in folders on the side bar. These can also be set on a per-
// project basis.
"folder_exclude_patterns": [".svn", ".git", ".hg", "CVS", "tmp/class-*", "tmp/es_*", "tmp/jshinter*", "tmp/replace_*", "tmp/static_compiler*", "tmp/template_compiler*", "tmp/tree_merger*", "tmp/coffee_script*", "tmp/concat-tmp*", "tmp/export_tree*", "tmp/sass_compiler*"]
{% endhighlight %}

### Usage with ember-addons.bs_for_ember

The Bootstrap for Ember addons requires the Handlebars compiler at runtime which is not part of the production build.  You will need to modify your `node_modules/ember-cli/lib/proccoli/ember-app.js` and change:

{% highlight javascript %}
  this.import({
    "development": 'vendor/handlebars/handlebars.js',
    "production":  'vendor/handlebars/handlebars.runtime.js'
  });
{% endhighlight %}

to

{% highlight javascript %}
  this.import({
    "development": 'vendor/handlebars/handlebars.js',
    "production":  'vendor/handlebars/handlebars.js'
  });
{% endhighlight %}
