### Atom

If you are using [Atom](https://atom.io) with `ember-cli`, there is a package available that allows you to run commands right from Atom.

`Atom -> Preferences -> Install`

Search for [ember-cli-helper](https://atom.io/packages/ember-cli-helper)

`Install`

### SublimeText 3

If you are using [SublimeText 3](http://www.sublimetext.com) with `ember-cli`, by default it will try to index all files in your `tmp` directory for its GoToAnything functionality.  This will cause your computer to come to a screeching halt @ 90%+ CPU usage.  Simply remove these directories from the folders ST3 watches:

`Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings -User`

{% highlight javascript %}
// folder_exclude_patterns and file_exclude_patterns control which files
// are listed in folders on the side bar. These can also be set on a per-
// project basis.
"folder_exclude_patterns": [".svn", ".git", ".hg", "CVS", "tmp/class-*", "tmp/es_*", "tmp/jshinter*", "tmp/replace_*", "tmp/static_compiler*", "tmp/template_compiler*", "tmp/tree_merger*", "tmp/coffee_script*", "tmp/concat-tmp*", "tmp/export_tree*", "tmp/sass_compiler*"]
{% endhighlight %}
