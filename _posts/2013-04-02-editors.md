### Atom

If you are using [Atom](https://atom.io) with `ember-cli`, there is a package available that allows you to run commands right from Atom.

`Atom -> Preferences -> Install`

Search for [ember-cli-helper](https://atom.io/packages/ember-cli-helper)

`Install`

### Emacs

If you are using [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with `ember-cli`, Emacs creates temporary backup, autosave, and lockfiles that interfere with broccoli watcher, so they need to either be moved out of the way or disabled. To do that, ensure your emacs configuration contains the following:

{% highlight lisp %}
(setq backup-directory-alist `((".*" . ,temporary-file-directory)))
(setq auto-save-file-name-transforms `((".*" ,temporary-file-directory t)))
(setq create-lockfiles nil)
{% endhighlight %}

An [ember-mode](https://github.com/madnificent/ember-mode) package is also available. It has shortcuts for quickly navigating files in ember projects, running generators, and running build, serve, and test tasks. It also includes support for linking build errors to files and minibuffer notifications of `ember serve` status. It can be installed from [MELPA](http://melpa.org/). To use MELPA, ensure your configuration contains the following:

{% highlight lisp %}
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
{% endhighlight %}

Then ember-mode can be installed from the package menu at `M-x package-list-packages`. After it is installed, add a file named `.dir-locals.el` to the root of your ember projects with the contents:

{% highlight lisp %}
((nil . ((mode . ember))))
{% endhighlight %}

to enable it inside those projects.


### Sublime Text

If you are using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) with `ember-cli`, by default it will try to index all files in your `tmp` directory for its GoToAnything functionality.  This will cause your computer to come to a screeching halt @ 90%+ CPU usage, and can significantly increase build times.  Simply remove these directories from the folders Sublime Text watches:

`Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User`

{% highlight javascript %}
// folder_exclude_patterns and file_exclude_patterns control which files
// are listed in folders on the side bar. These can also be set on a per-
// project basis.
"folder_exclude_patterns": [".svn", ".git", ".hg", "CVS", "tmp/class-*", "tmp/es_*", "tmp/jshinter*", "tmp/replace_*", "tmp/static_compiler*", "tmp/template_compiler*", "tmp/tree_merger*", "tmp/coffee_script*", "tmp/concat-tmp*", "tmp/export_tree*", "tmp/sass_compiler*"]
{% endhighlight %}

### WebStorm
If you are using [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) with `ember-cli`, you will need to modify your `.gitignore` file, enable `ECMAScript6` settings, and mark certain directories.

First, add the following line to `.gitignore`:
{% highlight bash %}
.idea
{% endhighlight %}

Next, from the WebStorm menu:

`File > Settings -> Languages & Frameworks -> JavaScript -> ECMAScript6`

Click 'OK' to close the Settings modal window.  

Next, in Webstorm's Project window right-click on each of the following directories, go to 'Mark Directory As' and mark as indicated:

Mark as `Excluded`:
{% highlight bash %}
/tmp
/dist
{% endhighlight %}

Mark as `Resource Root`:
{% highlight bash %}
/
/bower_components
/bower_components/ember-qunit/lib
/public
{% endhighlight %}

Mark as `Test Sources Root`:
{% highlight bash %}
/tests
{% endhighlight %}
