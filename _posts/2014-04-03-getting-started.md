### Prerequisites

#### Node

First, install the latest stable version of Node (version 0.12.x).

To do so, either follow the installation instructions on
[nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/), or use your preferred package manager (such
as [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX) if you have one.

After installing Node, verify that Node is set up correctly by typing the
following commands on the command line. Both should output help messages:

{% highlight bash %}
node --help
npm --help
{% endhighlight %}

#### Ember CLI

Once you've installed Node, you'll need to install the Ember CLI globally with:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install -g ember-cli
{% endhighlight %}

This will give you access to the `ember` command-line runner.

If you are on Windows and interested in better performing builds 
(who isn't?) you are encouraged to make sure you have 
[symlinks on Windows](/user-guide/#symlinks-on-windows) enabled.  

#### Bower

You'll need to install [Bower](http://bower.io), a package manager that keeps
your front-end dependencies (including jQuery, Ember, and QUnit) up to date.
This is as easy as running:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install -g bower
{% endhighlight %}

This will give you access to the `bower` command-line runner.

#### Watchman

On OSX and UNIX-like operating systems, we recommended installing
[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) version 3.x, which provides
a more effective way for Ember CLI to watch for project changes by hooking
into your system's native filesystem events.

Example command installing Watchman using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX.

{% highlight bash %}
brew install watchman
{% endhighlight %}

OSX filewatching has issues that can result in it easily entering a broken state,
while Node's built in `NodeWatcher` has trouble observing large trees. Watchman
is developed and used by Facebook to make file-watching work even on extremely massive
file trees. You can read more about their motivations in their [announcement here](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/watchman-faster-builds-with-large-source-trees/10151457195103920).

For complete installation instructions refer to the docs on the [Watchman website](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/).

When Watchman is not installed, you will see this notice which can be safely ignored.

{% highlight bash %}
Could not find watchman, falling back to NodeWatcher for file system events
{% endhighlight %}

There is also a conflicting `npm` package named `watchman`, so make sure that
it is not in your `PATH` to avoid conflicts.  If the `npm` package is installed, you may see the
following warning.

{% highlight bash %}
invalid watchman found, version: [2.9.8] did not satisfy [^3.0.0], falling back to NodeWatcher
{% endhighlight %}

The following command will let you inspect which Watchmans you have.

{% highlight bash %}
which -a watchman
{% endhighlight %}

If you have installed the wrong Watchman, you can use npm uninstall to remove it.

{% highlight bash %}
npm uninstall -g watchman
{% endhighlight %}

#### PhantomJS

You can use the automated test runner of your choice with Ember CLI, however most testing
services will recommend or require [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), which you can install
via [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/).

PhantomJS is the default test runner for [Testem](https://github.com/airportyh/testem) and [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html).

If you want to use PhantomJS to run your integration tests, it needs to be installed globally.

{% highlight bash %}
npm install -g phantomjs
{% endhighlight %}

### Create a new project

Run the generator for your project:

{% highlight bash %}
ember new my-new-app
{% endhighlight %}

This will create a new `my-new-app` directory and generate an application structure for you.

Once the generation process finishes, launch the app:

{% highlight bash %}
cd my-new-app
npm install && bower install
ember server
{% endhighlight %}

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to see your new app in action.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/tests` to see your test results in action.

#### Migrating an existing project that doesn't yet use Ember CLI

If your app uses the deprecated Ember App Kit, there is a [migration guide](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit#migrating-to-ember-cli) located
on the README.

If your app uses globals (e.g. `App.Post`) from a different build pipeline such as Grunt, Ember-Rails, or Gulp,
you can try using the [Ember CLI migrator](https://github.com/fivetanley/ember-cli-migrator). The
Ember CLI migrator is a command line tool that looks at your JavaScript code using
a JavaScript parser and rewrites your code to ES6 following Ember CLI's conventions.
The migrator keeps your code style and keeps git history available via
`git log --follow`.

#### Cloning an existing project

Alternatively, if you are checking out an existing Ember project created with Ember CLI,
you will need to install dependencies yourself before running the server:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git@github.com:me/my-app.git
cd my-app
npm install
bower install
ember server
{% endhighlight %}

### Using Ember CLI

 Command                                     | Purpose
 :------------------------------------------ | :-------
 `ember`                                     | Prints out a list of available commands.
 `ember new <app-name>`                      | Creates a directory called `<app-name>` and generates an application structure for you.  If git is available the directory will be initialized as a git repository and an initial commit will be created.  Use  `--skip-git` flag to disable this feature.
 `ember init`                                | Generates an application structure for you in the current directory.
 `ember build`                               | Builds the application to `dist/` directory (customize via `--output-path` flag). Use `--environment` flag to specify the environment to build for (defaults to `development`). Use `--watch` flag keep the process running, observing the filesystem and rebuilding when changes occur.
 `ember server`                              | Starts up the server. Default port is `4200`. Use `--proxy` flag to proxy all ajax requests to the given address. For example `ember server --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080` will proxy all your apps XHR to your server running at port 8080.
 <span style="white-space:nowrap">`ember generate <generator-name> <options>`</span> | Runs a specific generator. To see available generators, run `ember help generate`.
 <span style="white-space:nowrap">`ember destroy <generator-name> <options>`</span> | Uninstalls a module created by the generator command.  If the module was generated with the `--pod` option, then its removal needs to also include `--pod`.
 `ember test`                                | Run tests with Testem on CI mode. You can pass any options to Testem through `testem.json`, by default we'll search for it under your project's root or you can specify `config-file`.
 `ember install <addon-name>`                | Installs the given addon to your project and saves it to the `package.json`. It will run the addon's `defaultBlueprint` if it provides one.

### Folder Layout

 File/directory         | Purpose
 :-------------      | :-------
 `app/`              | Contains your Ember application's code. Javascript files in this directory are *compiled* through the ES6 module transpiler and concatenated into a file called `app.js`. See the table below for more details.
 `dist/`             | Contains the *distributable* (that is, optimized and self-contained) output of your application. Deploy this to your server!
 `public/`           | This directory will be copied verbatim into the root of your built application. Use this for assets that don't have a build step, such as images or fonts.
 `tests/`            | Includes unit and integration tests for your app, as well as various helpers to load and run your tests.
 `tmp/`              | Various temporary output of build steps, as well as the debug output of your application (`tmp/public`).
 `bower_components/` | Your dependencies, both those included with `Ember CLI` and those installed with `Bower`.
 `vendor/`           | Your external dependencies not installed with `Bower` or `npm`.
 `.jshintrc`         | [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) configuration.
 `.gitignore`        | Git configuration for ignored files.
 `ember-cli-build.js` | Contains build specification for [Broccoli](https://github.com/joliss/broccoli).
 `bower.json`        | Bower configuration and dependency list. See [Managing Dependencies](#managing-dependencies).
 `package.json`      | npm configuration. Mainly used to list the dependencies needed for asset compilation.

### Layout within `app` directory

 File/directory    | Purpose
 :------------- | :-------
 `app/app.js` | Your application's entry point. This is the module that is first executed.
 `app/index.html` | The only actual page of your single-page app! Includes dependencies and kickstarts your Ember application. See [app/index.html](#appindexhtml).
 `app/router.js` | Your route configuration. The routes defined here correspond to routes in `app/routes/`.
 `app/styles/` | Contains your stylesheets, whether SASS, LESS, Stylus, Compass, or plain CSS (though only one type is allowed, see [Asset Compilation](#asset-compilation)). These are all compiled into `app.css`.
 `app/templates/` | Your Handlebars templates. These are compiled to `/dist/assets/<yourapp>.js`. The templates are named the same as their filename, minus the extension (i.e. `templates/foo/bar.hbs` -> `foo/bar`).
 `app/controllers/`, `app/models/`, etc. | Modules resolved by the Ember CLI resolver. See [Using Modules &amp; the Resolver](#using-modules).

[PhantomJS]: http://phantomjs.org
[Homebrew]: http://brew.sh

#### `app/index.html`

The `app/index.html` file lays the foundation for your application. This is where the basic DOM structure is laid out, the title attribute is set and stylesheet/javascript includes are done. In addition to this, `app/index.html` includes multiple hooks - `{% raw %}{{content-for 'head'}}{% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}{{content-for 'body'}}{% endraw %}` - that can be used by [addons](#addons) to inject content into your application's `head` or `body`.  These hooks need to be left in place for your application to function properly, but they can be safely ignored unless you are working directly with a particular addon.

### Addons

Addons are registered in npm with a keyword of `ember-addon`. See a full list of existing addons registered in NPM [here](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/keyword/ember-addon).
