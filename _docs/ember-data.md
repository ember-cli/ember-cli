The current beta Ember Data is included with Ember CLI.

Ember Data has recently undergone a major reboot, drastically simplifying it and
making it easier to use with the Ember resolver. Here's some tips for using it
within Ember CLI.

To use ember-cli without Ember Data remove the dependency from package.json
(the same applies for [ic-ajax](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-ic-ajax))

  `npm rm ember-data --save-dev`


### Models

Models are critical in any dynamic web application. Ember Data makes making
models extremely easy.

For example, we can create a `todo` model like so:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// models/todo.js
import DS from "ember-data";

export default DS.Model.extend({
  title: DS.attr('string'),
  isCompleted: DS.attr('boolean'),
  quickNotes: DS.hasMany('quick-note')
});

// models/quick-note.js
import DS from "ember-data";

export default DS.Model.extend({
  name: DS.attr('string'),
  todo: DS.belongsTo('todo')
});

{% endhighlight %}

Note, that filenames should be all lowercase and dasherized - this is used by the
*Resolver* automatically.

### Adapters & Serializers

Ember Data makes heavy use of *per-type* adapters and serializers. These objects
can be resolved like any other.

Adapters can be placed at `/app/adapters/type.js`:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// adapters/post.js
import DS from "ember-data";

export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({});
{% endhighlight %}

And its serializer can be placed in `/app/serializers/type.js`:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// serializers/post.js
import DS from "ember-data";

export default DS.RESTSerializer.extend({});
{% endhighlight %}

Application-level (default) adapters and serializers should be named
`adapters/application.js` and `serializers/application.js`, respectively.

### Mocks and fixtures

If you're used to using fixtures to get test data into your app during
development, you won't be able to create fixture data like you're
used to doing (i.e. [as specified in the guides](http://emberjs.com/guides/models/the-fixture-adapter/)).
This is because the models in your Ember CLI app (like all other 
objects) aren't attached to the global namespace.

Ember CLI comes with an **http-mock** generator which is preferred to
fixtures for development and testing. Mocks have several advantages
over fixtures, a primary one being that they interact with your 
application's adapters. Since you'll eventually be hooking your app
up to a live API, it's wise to be testing your adapters from the onset.

To create a mock for a `posts` API endpoint, use

```
ember g http-mock posts
```

A basic [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) server will be scaffolded for
your endpoint under `/your-app/server/mocks/posts.js`. Once you add the 
appropriate JSON response, you're ready to go. The next time you run
`ember serve`, your new mock server will be listening for any API requests
from your Ember app.

> Note: Mocks are just for development and testing. The entire `/server` 
directory will be ignored during `ember build`.

If you decide to use fixtures instead of mocks, you'll need to use 
`reopenClass` within your model class definitions. First, create a fixture
adapter, either for a single model or your entire application:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// adapters/application.js
import DS from "ember-data";

export default DS.FixtureAdapter.extend({});
{% endhighlight %}

Then add fixture data to your model class:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// models/author.js
import DS from "ember-data";

var Author = DS.Model.extend({
  firstName: DS.attr('string'),
  lastName: DS.attr('string')
});

Author.reopenClass({
  FIXTURES: [
    {id: 1, firstName: 'Bugs', lastName: 'Bunny'},
    {id: 2, firstName: 'Wile E.', lastName: 'Coyote'}
  ]
});

export default Author;
{% endhighlight %}

Your Ember app's API requests will now use your fixture data.
