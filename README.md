## Warning

Although potentially exciting, this is still really a WIP, use at your own risk.

## Project Elements
Additional components of this project which are used runtime in your application:
* [ember-jj-abrams-resolver](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-jj-abrams-resolver)
* [loader](https://github.com/stefanpenner/loader.js)
* [ember-cli-shims](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli-shims)
* [ember-load-initializers](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-load-initializers)

## Development Hints
### Working with master

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli.git
cd ember-cli
npm link
```

`npm link` is very similar to `npm install -g` except that instead of downloading the package from the repo the just cloned `ember-cli/` folder becomes the global package. Any changes to the files in the `ember-cli/` folder will immediately affect the global ember-cli package.

Now you can use `ember-cli` via the command line:

``` sh
ember new foo
cd foo
npm link ember-cli
ember server
```

You may also need to run `ember init` immediately after doing npm link ember-cli.

Finally if you are having problems with merge-tree, then check to make sure that you don't have both a vendor and bower-components directory.  

`npm link ember-cli` is needed because by default the globally installed `ember-cli` just loads the local `ember-cli` from the project. `npm link ember-cli` symlinks the global `ember-cli` package to the local `ember-cli` package. Now the `ember-cli` you cloned before is in three places: The folder you cloned it into, npm's folder where it stores global packages and the `ember-cli` project you just created.

If you upgrade an app running against Ember CLI master you will need to re-link to your checkout of Ember CLI by running `npm link ember-cli` in your project again.

Please read the official [npm-link documentation](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-link.html) and the [npm-link cheatsheet](https://blog.nodejitsu.com/npm-cheatsheet/#Linking_any_npm_package_locally) for more information.

### Working with the tests

Use `npm run autotest` to run the tests after every file change (Runs only fast tests). Use `npm test` to run them once.

For a full test run which includes some very slow acceptance tests,
please run: `npm run test-all`. Please note, this is what travis
runs.

To exclude a test or test suite append a `.skip` to `it()` or `describe()` respectively (e.g. `it.skip(...)`). To focus on a certain test or test suite append `.only`.

Please read the official [mocha documentation](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha) for more information.

## Problems

When running ember cli it could happen that a lack of file watches can occur. You will get an error message like:

```sh
Serving on http://0.0.0.0:4200
watch ENOSPC
Error: watch ENOSPC
    at errnoException (fs.js:1019:11)
    at FSWatcher.start (fs.js:1051:11)
  ...
```

This problem will be corrected in future releases. The following line is a workaround to get the server up and running until this problem is fixed. See [Issue 1054](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/issues/1054).

```sh
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```
