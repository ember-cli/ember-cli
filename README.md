## Development Hints
### Working with master

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli.git
cd ember-cli
npm link
```

`npm link` is very similar to `npm install -g` except that instead of downloading the package from the repo the just cloned `ember-cli/` folder becomes the global package. Any changes to the files in the `ember-cli/` folder will immediatly affect the global ember-cli package.

Now you can use `ember-cli` via the command line:

``` sh
ember new foo
cd foo
npm link ember-cli
ember server
```

`npm link ember-cli` is needed because by default the globally installed `ember-cli` just loads the local `ember-cli` from the project. `npm link ember-cli` symlinks the global `ember-cli` package to the local `ember-cli` package. Now the `ember-cli` you cloned before is in three places: The folder you cloned it into, npm's folder where it stores global packages and the `ember-cli` project you just created.

If you upgrade an app running against Ember CLI master you will need to re-link to your checkout of Ember CLI by running `npm link ember-cli` in your project again.

Please read the official [npm-link documentation](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-link.html) and the [npm-link cheatsheet](https://blog.nodejitsu.com/npm-cheatsheet/#Linking_any_npm_package_locally) for more information.

### Working with the tests

Use `npm run-script autotest` to run the tests after every file change (Runs only fast tests). Use `npm test` to run them once.

For a full test run which includes some very slow acceptance tests,
please run: `npm run-script test-all`. Please note, this is what travis
runs.

To exclude a test or test suite append a `.skip` to `it()` or `describe()` respectively (e.g. `it.skip(...)`). To focus on a certain test or test suite append `.only`.

Please read the official [mocha documentation](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha) for more information.
