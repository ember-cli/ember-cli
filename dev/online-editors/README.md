# Online Editor output:

repo: https://github.com/ember-cli/editor-output

For each supported online editor, there should be a folder
with the online-editor-specific files for that online editor.

For example:

```
stackblitz/
  .stackblitzrc
other-editor/
  .other-editor.js
```

This would result in the following branches on the
editor-output repo:

- stackblitz-app-output
- stackblitz-addon-output
- other-editor-app-output
- other-editor-addon-output
