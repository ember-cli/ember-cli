# ember-cli Changelog

* [FEATURE] Added support for ember-scripts preprocessing.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Refactor `test-loader.js` for readability and to prevent unnecessary iterations [#524]
* [ENHANCEMENT] Remove `Ember.setupForTesting` and
  `Router.reopen({location: 'none'});` from test helpers [#516].
* [ENHANCEMENT] Update loom-generators-ember-appkit to `^1.1.1`.
* [BUGFIX] On `init`, check `pkg` existence before reading name.

### 0.0.25

* [BUGFIX] The blueprinted application's `package.json` forces an older version of `ember-cli`. Fixed in [#518](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/518).

### 0.0.24

* Changes to `index.html`: Script tags were moved into body, `ENV` and the app are now defined in the same script tag.
* introduce NULL Project, to gracefully handle out-of-project
  invocations of the cli. Like new/init [fixes #502]
* pre 1.0.0 dependency are now locked down to exact versions, post 1.0.0 deps are in good faith semver locked.
* patch to quickfix some broccoli + Windows IO issues. We expect a proper solution soon, but this will hold us over (#493)[https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/493]
* Add a custom watcher to make broccoli more usable on windows by catching file errors ([493](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/493)).
* Allow `ember new` and `ember init` to receive a `blueprint` argument to allow for alternative project scaffolding ([462](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/462))
* Add `ember test` with Testem integration ([388](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/388)).
* some improvements to bower dependency management, unfortunately until bower.json stabilizes broccoli-bower stability is at the whim of bower component authors.
* introduce maintainable + upgradable ember app specific brocfile filter
  ([396](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/396))
* ember cli now attempts to use the project-local ember-cli if
  available, this should help with people who have multiple versions of
  the cli installed. ([5a3c9a](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/commit/5a3c9a97e407c128939feb5bd8cd98db2a8e3181))
* Complete restructuring of how ember-cli works internally
* `ember help` now offers nicely colored output
* Extracts shims in vendor into bower package ([#342](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/342))
  * locks it to version `0.0.1`
* Extracts initializers autoloading into bower package ([#337](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/337))
  * locks it to version `0.0.1`
* Introduces broccoli-bower ([#333](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/333))
  * locks it to version `0.2.0`
* Fix issue where app.js files are appended to tests.js ([#347](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/347))
* upgrade broccoli to `0.9.0` [v0.9.0 brocfile changes](https://gist.github.com/joliss/15630762fa0f43976418)
* Use configuration from `config/environments.js` to pass options to `Ember.Application.create`. ([#370](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/370))
* Adds `ic-ajax` to the list of ignored modules for tests([#378](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/378))
* Adds per command help output ([#376](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/376))
* Ensures that the broccoli trees are cleaned up properly. ([#444](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/444))
* Integrate leek package for ember-cli usage analytics reporting. ([#448](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/448))
* Generate current live build to `tmp/output/` when running `ember server`. This is very useful for
  debugging the current Broccoli tree without manually running `ember build`. ([#457](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/457))
* Use `tmp/output/` directory created in [#457](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/457) for Testem setup.
  This allows using the `testem` command to run Testem in server mode (allowing capturing multiple browsers and other goodies). [#463](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/463)
* Added `ember test --server` to run the `testem` command line server. `ember test --server` will automatically re-run your tests after a rebuild. [#474](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/474)
* Add JSHinting for `app/` and `test/` trees when building in development. This generates console logs as well as QUnit tests (so that `ember test` shows failures). [#482](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/482)
* Use the name specified in `package.json` while doing `ember init`. This allows you to use a different application name than your folder name. [#491](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/491)
* Allow disabling live reload via `ember server --live-reload=false`. [#510](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/510)
